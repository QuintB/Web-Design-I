<h1>Text from the graphic (you had mentioned you wanted it in the html)</h1>
<p>Q&amp;A is a podcast, review, tutorial, and technology community. We have a weekly podcast on the latest tech news, put out a new tutorial regarding some kind of software every week, and review one product every week. The idea is that with weekly content on a staggered release schedule, we can get people to return to the site at least once a week, if not more, which helps engagement.</p>
<p>When I think of the type of person I think will browse our website, my mind immediately goes to an image of a white, college-aged, middle to high class male that is some sort of tech enthusiast. However, while this may be our highest demographic, the target demographic is simply college-aged, middle to high class males and females.</p>
<p>Because of the simplicity I hope to communicate, the fonts I will- use are all various weights of Helvetica Nueue. I will employ <strong>Bold</strong> text to highlight section titles and navigation status, and regular text for body and regular items.</p>
<p>When prototyping this website, I was very drawn to the way the shadows work on the main logo, so I wanted to incorporate this in the rest of the website. White, bright UI elements with subtle shadows will be a staple motif. Also a fan of soft blurs to make UI elements pop, having a blurred, desaturated background image will keep the webpage visually interestign enough, while not being too distracating from the main content of the page. </p>
<p>Qna.com is for people who like to talk about tech. It’s for people who want to learn more. It’s a place to hang out and listen to two guys talk about what happened last week. All with a gorgeous, stylish setting that encourages people to explore.

From the soft shadows to indicate hierarchy, to the Bold text that does the same. From the frosted, blurred backgrounds, to the clean, white UI elements. From the header, to the footer. This is Q&A.</p>
