When you get more than a million daily active users, there comes a point where you expect the design of something to be done well enough that everything is easy to find, stuff makes sense, and new users are able to onboard fairly quickly.
<br> <br>
Facebook Messenger accomplishes this. Snapchat, unfortunately, does not.
<br> <br>
Lets look at Facebook messenger. When you load the app, It gives you the top three most recent conversations at the top, some people that are active now at the bottom, and a navigation bar stuck to the base of the screen that lets you call people, see groups, and take a live video to share with all your friends immediately - the main function of the app. Swiping down also does the same thing. If I tap on a conversation, it pops up with the texts, and I'm able to go back by swiping back, a natural gesture. When typing, I can send text, audio, and pictures, which are all other buttons next to the text button. I can also send emojis and animations in response to a certain message someone else sent.
<br> <br>
Snapchat decided, for some reason, that it would be better to start off on the camera screen, meaning I can't see all the messages people have sent me at a glance; the whole point of the app is seeing and sending messages. It also delineates text and picture messages for some reason, so I have to swipe to the left in order to see those. To open a thread, instead of tapping on the conversation, I have to swipe left on it. To open a message, though, I would tap on the conversation when the message is in the inbox. To send a message to someone in particular, I have to double-tap their name, instead of tapping it and sending it in the thread view. To share my profile with someone, instead of using a username, there are these weird QR codes that are available only by swiping down on the camera view. This is also where the settings are, for some reason, along with the area for managing your contacts.
<br> <br>
People also have "stories", which are a one-to-many post from one profile to all that profiles followers. That is found by swiping right in a completely different area, instead of where you would expect it, in the chat of the person that you're talking to. You can also swipe right again (instead of having a tappable menu bar at the bottom for all this) to find corporate stories, which have no rhyme nor reason to their layout. To edit the stories you see, you tap on the stories button at the bottom of the screen, not an edit button like you normally would.
<br> <br>
Snapchat goes against the grain to be different, but that means ostracizing new users that have no idea how to use their app. It's difficult to understand, and the on boarding process is basically nonexistent. The way it does things doesnâ€™t make sense.
